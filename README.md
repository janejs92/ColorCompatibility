# ColorCompatibility

In iOS 13, Apple introduced a bunch of new system colors (label, systemBackground, etc). These colors dynamically adapt to the preferred user interface style, but these colors aren't available on iOS < 13. ColorCompatibility is an autogenerated library which allows you to specify the system colors as static vars of the ColorCompatibility namespace, instead of UIColor. Using this will make colors "just work" on both iOS 13+ and iOS <= 12. On iOS <= 12, the colors default to Apple's light mode colors.

Please note: there are some system colors (like `systemGray`, `systemBlue` etc) which have been available before iOS 13. This library does not currently provide fallbacks for these colors - you can use `UIColor` to access them. Feel free to submit an issue if you have a use case for including these colors in this library's enum!

E.g.:

```
import ColorCompatibility

myView.backgroundColor = ColorCompatibility.label
```

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

### CocoaPods
ColorCompatibility is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'ColorCompatibility'
```

### Swift Package Manager
ColorCompatability is available as a Swift package. To install, add `https://github.com/noahsark769/ColorCompatibility.git` as a package dependency in Xcode for a version >= 1.0.1, or as a dependency of another package:

```
let package = Package(
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/noahsark769/ColorCompatibility.git", ...)
    ]
)
```

If you'd prefer not to use Cocoapods or SPM, I recommend copy and pasting the `ColorCompatibility.swift` code directly into your project. It's only one file üëç

## Notes
When dropping in `UIColor` in place of `ColorCompatibility` when your app drops support for iOS 12, it's not strictly guaranteed that all colors behave the same way: for example, in iOS 13, system colors adapt to display differently when they're in an "elevated" context, like the background color of a view controller presented modally. For more information on elevated colors, see [the Human Interface Guidelines on Dark Mode](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/dark-mode/).
